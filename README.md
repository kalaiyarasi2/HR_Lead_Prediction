HR Lead Prediction - Machine Learning Challenge üöÄ

Overview

This project aims to predict which companies are "hot leads" for HR services. We used machine learning models to analyze company funding, hiring trends, and industry growth to make accurate predictions.

Problem Statement

HR service providers want to focus on companies that are most likely to buy their services. Instead of guessing, we use data to predict if a company will engage with HR services.

The dataset contains information like:

Funding rounds (How many times the company raised money)
Total funding received
Hiring activity (Job postings, employee growth)
Industry and regional trends
Our goal is to train a model that can predict whether a company is a hot lead (1) or not a hot lead (0)

Approach

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
‚úÖ Handling missing values: We removed or filled missing values.
‚úÖ Encoding categorical data: Converted text data (like "industry") into numbers.
‚úÖ Feature scaling: Standardized numerical features for better model performance.
‚úÖ Feature engineering: Added new features like Funding Per Employee and Growth Index.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection & Training
We trained multiple models and picked the best one based on F1-score:
‚úî Logistic Regression üèÜ (Baseline Model)
‚úî Random Forest Classifier üå≤
‚úî XGBoost Classifier ‚ö° (Best performer!)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Making Predictions & Submission
The best model predicted which companies were hot leads.
We saved predictions in submission.csv (company_id, is_hot_lead).
Uploaded the results to GitHub and submitted them to the competition.
